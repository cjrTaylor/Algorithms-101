# Algorithms-101

This repository will be a collection of all algorithms I encounter during study and other sources. <br />
Every algorithm will be in python, until otherwise updated. <br />
Each algorithm will have a .py and a .md file. <br />
  - The .py file will include only the algorithm, it will not include any main method. <br />
  - The .md file will include a description of the algorithm, time complexity analysis and extra information. <br />

This project is currently ongoing and will recieve regualr updates. <br />
